##	Sort by Card Type, Note Type, or Deck Name  

This addon makes the **Card**, **Note**, and **Deck** columns in the browser sortable. Sorting is case-insensitive. The search box cannot be empty.

If the (primary) sort key is the card type, then the secondary sort key is the note type; and vice versa. For instance, if one searches for (say) “human” and then clicks on the **Note** column, the cards are sorted first by note type and then by card type.
